Cricketers Data Analytics

In this project I have worked on the cricketers data from ESPN website with top Cricketers. https://www.espncricinfo.com/records/highest-career-batting-average-282910 the link is provided to have a look n data.

Steps Followed to the Analytics:----

1. DATA COLLECTION: I collected the data from ESPN CRICK INFO website and load it to the excel sheet to woork on it.

3. DATA CLEANING : After loading the data in to the excel file I saved it to the suitable folder and then after observing the data I worked on cleaning the data by eliminating or filling the missing values. Changing the format of the values from string to integers as the columns like Balls_faced, Strike_rate, 4s, 6s contains the values like 5*, 800+, 89+, 6+. So I removed the extra symbols that were messing up the data.

4. Finding the duplicate entries and eliminating them.

5. Feature Engineering: I created suitable columns from the existing columns so that the future calculations will become easy and sorted. I splitted the TIME SPAN {for which the player played} column to the Rookie year and Final Year respectively. Player Name column contains the country name also So I just splitted them to two columns.
